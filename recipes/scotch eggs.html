    <h2>Description</h2>
    Scotch eggs are soft-boiled eggs wrapped in sausage and bread crumbs, deep-fried for a delicious savory treat. They're a British pub favorite, perfect for family occasions or picnics. We like to make these on Christmas Eve served on a bed of lettuce with sliced tomatoes and mustard for garnish.

        <li>1 quart oil for frying</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
